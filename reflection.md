Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
 Sakura & Jo. 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Wednesday 7-9 (did not have any specific questions so my name wasn't on the board)
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I was very confused at first, but I think I am coming around to it. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
The class system and objects are similar between the two, but I feel like python may be slightly more intuitive. I feel like I have not done enough in depth work in either to draw proper conclusions yet. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think the advice given in class about working it out on a whiteboard or something before coding is very helpful, because then you only need to worry about figuring out the syntax. I realized I did not do the find and replace way which I am a bit confused about.
